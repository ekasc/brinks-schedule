## Agent Guidelines

### 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- If uncertainty materially changes the implementation, ask. Otherwise, state the assumption and proceed with the most reversible option.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- Do not add defensive handling for states already excluded by validated invariants, types, or trusted boundaries.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

### 5. Verify the Actual Change

Do not claim completion from code inspection alone.

Before finishing:
- Run the narrowest relevant tests first.
- Then run the broader affected test suite.
- Run formatting, linting, type-checking, and build checks when applicable.
- Inspect the final diff for unrelated changes.
- Report exactly what was verified and what was not.

Never say "should work" when verification was available.
Never hide failing checks.

## Git Boundaries (critical)

- Git operations are only performed when the user explicitly issues them:
  `git commit`, `git push`, branch creation/deletion, PR creation/merging,
  remote or tag mutations, and any deployment promotion.
- Editing a file in the working tree is not a git operation and needs no
  permission. Committing or pushing that edit does.
- When in doubt, make the file change, show what changed, and ask before
  running any git command.

## PR Communication (critical)

- PRs are authored by the user's account. Write PR titles and bodies as clean,
  professional release notes from the account owner: what changed and why.
- No meta-commentary, no instructions to the operator, no first/second-person
  notes about deployment process or review flow.
